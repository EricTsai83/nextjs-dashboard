## Folder structure

- **`/app`**: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
- **`/app/lib`**: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- **`/app/ui`**: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- **`/public`**: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- **`/scripts`**: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
- **Config Files**: You'll also notice config files such as `next.config.js` at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using `create-next-app`. You will not need to modify them in this course.

## Knowledge

### Automatic code-splitting and prefetching

To improve the navigation experience, Next.js automatically code splits your application by route segments. This is different from a traditional React [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA), where the browser loads all your application code on initial load.

Splitting code by routes means that pages become isolated. If a certain page throws an error, the rest of the application will still work.

Furthermore, in production, whenever [`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) components appear in the browser's viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked route in the background. By the time the user clicks the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and this is what makes the page transition near-instant!
